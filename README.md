  <p>I'm a software developer with a lot of curiosity who seeks to learn and improve my skills daily. In 2021 I got certified as a Full Stack Developer with Node.js, ReactJS, and react Native. In 2022 I received a certificate of completion for my path in Node.js at @rocketseat. Last but not least, I finished my technical high school in this same year (2022), so I'm a Computer technician too. 😊</p>
