  <h1 align="center" >Hi, there 👋</h1>

  <p >I am a skilled Node.js developer with a strong background in building scalable and efficient web applications. With experience using Prisma, TypeORM, Docker, and other technologies, I am proficient in developing robust and secure applications. I have acquired valuable knowledge in computer programming, networks, and hardware problem-solving through my education and training.

Additionally, I have completed an online course with Rocketseat, where I gained a solid foundation in Node.js and its application in building scalable and efficient web applications. I have been a part of several projects, including the e-Bov project, where I utilized Node.js to build the backend, implemented secure authentication using JWT and Bcrypt libraries for user login, and built an initial database structure using TypeORM and later migrated it to Prisma.
In my work, I prioritize a culture of code reuse and have experience with version control tools such as Github. I am a quick learner with excellent problem-solving skills and a critical thinker who enjoys working in a team environment.
